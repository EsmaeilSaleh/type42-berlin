# Type42 Berlin

**Type42 Berlin** is a terminal-based application designed to help students and C language enthusiasts practice writing `libft` functions. It's especially useful for 42 school students who want to improve their muscle memory and clean C coding skills.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Two practice modes:
  - **Copy Mode**: Code is displayed and you must retype it exactly
  - **Recall Mode**: Only the function name and description are shown — you must type the function from memory
- Fully compliant with **Norminette** rules
- Displays **score and typing accuracy** after each session
- Functions categorized by type (string, memory, list, I/O, etc.)
- Ideal for practicing **Libft**, preparing for **get_next_line**, **ft_printf**, and technical interviews

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen muscle memory for C standard functions
- Gain confidence in clean coding and syntax
- Prepare for coding challenges and C-based projects

---

## 🛠 Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EsmaeilSaleh/type42-berlin.git
cd type42-berlin
make
./type42
```

> The app runs in the terminal and uses a simple keylogger to compare your typed code with the expected version.
